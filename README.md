# Auris

Auris (latin for "ear") is a tester for the severity of clogged ears through music. I not infrequently get a clogged ear, ranging from "5% clogged" (can barely notice anything different, especially not in normal conversation) to "90% clogged" (can barely hear anything out of that ear). In particular this means that when I listen to music, the channel / side with the clogged ear will seem quieter.

I wrote auris both as a way to judge the severity of a clog and its impact on my music listening, and in the future to server as a placebo tester, to see if I really have a clog or am just imagining it.

### Future

* placebo tester - is your ear really clogged, ie can you tell the difference in randomly selected decibel levels. similar methodology to ABX bitrate tests (<http://abx.digitalfeed.net/>)
* add a ui - just a song selector and buttons for left/right, and maybe changing volume as well
